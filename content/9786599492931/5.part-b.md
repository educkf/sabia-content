> Under these circumstances, it is not enough for designers to be politically and chemically correct. “Organic”, “green”, “environmental”, and “sustainable” are buzzwords that have been applied in earnest to design – including food and fashion – over the last two decades, as have “ethical” and “aware”. Yet, despite these noble intentions, we are still, as individuals and communities, tracking a course of destruction through overconsumption and disregard for countless forms of life, including our own. Much design has been violent. (Antonelli, 2019)

### 1.1 Meeting point!

In this part of the book, we are going to look into design: how it is related to the socio-environmental-political crisis and how it can be part of a redirection of our individual or collective actions towards a more futuring culture. We shall start from analyzing briefly why design has been an ally of the aggressive hegemonic culture that we have studied in part A; then we will see some of the ways in which the alliance of design and sustainability has been unrolled in the last decades, by whom and following what visions; and finally we will see in more detail four design angles that can be analyzed and be part of a positive response to the crisis in politics of Nature. 

### 1.2 Where does design fit?

Much design has been violent. How come? To initiate the arguments on this topic, one might find useful defining _what design is_ - even though any attempt to do so seems forever insufficient.

Starting by borrowing the ample yet reasonable definition by Austrian designer Victor Papanek, design can be seen as “the conscious action to impose meaningful order”. Or, in other words, it’s about using creativity and technique to achieve a desired outcome (be the outcome well defined or not). This definition helps the analysis attempted in this work since it fits the many fashions in which design has been performed throughout history, crafting to industrial applications, to its contemporary multi-disciplinarity. This definition is also interesting because it is not centered in a legitimated figure (the _design professional_) and allows to include people that are not connected to the design field and even non-human beings in the activity (a bird is surely conscious that it is building a nest when it does so). This may seem silly at first, but, if we think about all we have studied so far in this book, around the issues of agency and power, it is an important step towards detaching design from the principles of hegemony. Furthermore, this notion of design, in its simplicity and non-attachment to a specific economic activity, allows interesting possibilities for the future. 

The origins of design are debated: according to some it comes from the crafting activities enrolled by people since the first shaping of tools (about 2.5 million years ago); according to others, the vast majority, design was born with the Industrial Revolution (starting around the second half of the 18th century). The matter of what are the roots of design (crafting or optimizing products for producing and selling) is an interesting and necessary debate that will not, however, be performed in this book. It is enough for now to understand that most designers place the establishment of our profession along with the ascent of the industrial activities and the modern lifestyle, as, in fact, it became a recognized profession then.  

Returning to the question highlighted in the title of this section, the answer is now (after many pages of theoretical delight since the first pages of this work), very simple. As a practice that became recognized and expanded alongside and in service of the rise of industrialization, it would be difficult for design to detach conceptually from these paradigms. Put simply and swiftly, all the negative and nature-depredating critiques that concern politics and economics apply also to the traditional applications of design. 

### 1.3 The first critiques to the unsustainability of design

We can find deeper analysis of all of these statements in the words of Victor Papanek and Argentinian design philosopher Tomas Maldonado, known as the pioneering critics of industrial design in the 20th century. As Papanek (1972) famously wrote as the first lines of his _Design for the Real World_:  _“There are professions more harmful than industrial design, but only a very few of them”_ (p. 14). This impactful choice of words was unprecedented, as design had rarely, until then, been regarded as an extremely influential practice, let alone dangerous. He continues:

> Today, industrial design has put murder on a mass production basis. By designing criminally unsafe automobiles that kill or maim nearly one million people around the world each year, by creating whole new species of permanent garbage to clutter up the landscape and by choosing materials and processes that pollute the air we breathe, designers have become a dangerous breed. And the skills needed in these activities are carefully taught to young people. (p. 14) 

The educational component of his argument is relevant. As a professor who lectured in different parts of the world, Papanek was able to perceive the influence the university could have on future professionals in the market. As he describes, by the time he lectured (before writing the _Design for the Real World_) there was no book that discussed critically the noxious outcomes of design and that offered alternatives on the practice. So he wrote one himself. Gladly, he does not only provide a detailed (and well-illustrated) analysis of the problems of design as it was up until 1972, but also a vision on what it should be.

> Design must be an innovative, highly creative, cross-disciplinary tool responsive to the true needs of men. It must be more research-oriented and we must stop defiling the earth itself with poorly designed objects and structures. (p. 15). 

In the book, before proposing his approach to design, Papanek takes a step back and looks into design’s history to contextualize its failure. He describes the rise of the profession with the support of Henry Dreyfuss’ _Designing for people_ (published in 1955), in which the need for a figure who would aid the industry in the creation of optimized products during the Industrial Revolution is appointed as the foundation stone of the field. By placing the birth of design along the development of industrial activities, design thinkers from the 20th century such as Papanek and Dreyfuss frame the design field inside the realm of the manufacturing of objects and in the time arch of the rise of modernity. Though questionable (Papanek himself admits that other theorists place the birth of design on the prehistoric rise of human’s ability to make tools), this understanding is useful to comprehend and support design critiques as an activity strongly connected to the advances of modernity. The argument becomes increasingly clear as Papanek (1972) continues: _“. . . it was not until Walter Gropious founded the German Bauhaus in 1919, that an uneasy marriage between art and machine was achieved. No design school in history has had greater influence in shaping taste and design than the Bauhaus.”_ (p. 44). 

According to the author, the influence that Bauhaus has had reverberated throughout the decades (and by now, centuries) since most curricula of design schools all over the world followed the basis of their design course. As creatively effervescent and disrupting as the Bauhausian experience might have been, it was still bound to the modern missions of explorations on rationalism and functionalism. A model of design education in which the debate revolves around the many possible interactions of form and function, subordinated to the structures of a system that is based in the consumption of goods and services, can only result in a defuturing practice.

Back to Papanek, in the long term, designers had become professionals disconnected from the true needs of most people, working for the small and powerful percentage of the population. And this dedication of designers to the wrong “problems” (framed by industrialists who intended to accumulate their resources) helped, according to him, to develop a “Kleenex Culture” (Kleenex is a brand of disposable tissues), meaning that while individual possession is valued, durability is not.

It could only be reversed if designers regained consciousness of our social responsiveness and environmental responsibility and turned around design culture from what it was in the 1970s: [the role of the designer would not be to subordinate to companies, but to assist design-able communities to create solutions to their own problems]{.highlight}. Finally, he adds the conservation of Nature as an essential element of care for the profession: 

> If design is ecologically responsive, then it is also revolutionary. All systems – capitalist, state socialist, and mixed economies – are built on the assumption that we must buy more, consume more, waste more, throw away more, and consequently destroy Liferaft Earth. If design is to be ecologically responsible, it must be independent of concern for gross national product (no matter how gross that may be). (Papanek, 1972, p. 241)

This work was one of the first to approach environmental responsibility for the practitioners of this field. A second pioneer important to mention is Tomás Maldonado, Argentinian artist and design philosopher who wrote about the urgent needs to consider the influence of our projects on the environment in his inaugural book _Design, Nature and Revolution: Toward a critical ecology_. In this intense and intriguing work, he discourses about many concepts that he considered pertinent to understanding the connection between the field, politics, and the environment (both natural and man-made). His analyses thoroughly examines each term, offering insight in its pertinence for design, city planning and, consequently, the life of people in urban environments.

In his critique of the design-nature-politics nexus, he remarks the difference between his views and those of Buckminster Fuller. The North American architect is mostly well known for designing large scale geodesic structures from the decade of 1950 on. _“The opposite of design is chaos”_, he writes, in a text intriguingly typed for the introduction of Papanek’s _Design for the Real World_ (he claims that even though both had radically different views of the political application of design, they respected and admired each other's work). Fuller found designs _raison d’être_ in the perfect geometries found in nature, which are responsible for holding our body tissues together and allow plants to grow and life to exist (what he calls subjective design). Through his hands, projects that connected these extremely rationalistic and generative shapes to high technology in response to the cries of the scientific society about our imminent environmental catastrophe. Probably the most iconic of these projects is the Dome Over Manhattan, a project in which Fuller and Asian American architect Shoji Sadao envision the metropolis enclosed in a geodesic bubble, which, in their theory, would reduce its use of energy by 20% by creating a greenhouse effect. Interestingly, figures such as Buckminster Fuller spread a vision of design that was rather popular in the 20th century: that design and technology could hold back the environmental crisis, or at least, hold it away from human beings.

Though Maldonado, as Fuller, highly regards the importance of technology to the innovation in design and the construction of a new society (in contrast with Papanek who focuses his theory, at least discursively, around design methods and philosophy), the space politics occupies in their world visions oppose. Maldonado writes that, while the architect believes in a “Revolution by Design”, that is, the idea that technology might replace the function of politics by its ability to solve humanity's problems (what Maldonado calls a _technocratic utopianism_), he understands that this revolution would only makes sense if there is a “Design by Revolution”, which is the construction of a collective world based on political praxis, radically against designers nihilism (p. 29). 

This statement praises the political power of design inside a society and denounces the risk of not recognizing it. To make these concepts more tangible, we can go back to Papanek when he says that the role attributed to the creators of “things” is also one of selecting tools and operations of production and usage. And in fact, when one analyses what it takes to make “things” materialize, it's clear that many philosophical, mechanical and chemical processes are involved. There are visions, strategies and tangible results that have a direct impact on Nature and in people's lives. This understanding helps us build an important bridge to why and how design impacts directly politics of Nature, and why, even in its first manifestations, sustainable-minded design was already inevitably political.

### 1.4 The evolution of Design for Sustainability

From _“Design for The Real World”_ in the 1970s and what we have today, much has happened. Design itself has shifted in many levels, from the internal logic to its connection to other fields of knowledge, as we can see in Table 5 drawn from Escobar (2019, p. 34). Design evolved from a mostly industrial activity (essentially related to the production of material culture) into a form of experience-based thinking (related to the organization of experiences, be them material or immaterial) (Escobar, 2019, p. 37; Forlano, 2016).

Meanwhile, the questionings on the unsustainability of design covered many different perspectives, ranging from the condemnation of programmed obsolescence to the creation of systems for disassembly and recycling, pervading the matter of social innovation. Many theoretical and practical initiatives are part of what we can call the history of Design for Sustainability (DfS), or design that has at its center the aim of being positive for politics of Nature. 

These many propositions for DfS were carefully registered by researchers Idil Gaziulusoy and Fabrizio Ceschin (2016, 2019) in a paper and then in their book “Design for Sustainability: A Multi-level Framework from Products to Socio-technical Systems'' (2020). With an analysis starting from Papanek and Fuller, going through the concepts of Green Design, Design for Sustainable Behavior, System Design, and so on, they offer an “overview of the evolution of the response from the design discipline to sustainability issues” (Gaziulusoy & Ceschin, 2016, p. 120), explaining what, for them, the most relevant contributions in this field are. This information is gathered in Table 6, borrowed from their work.

The authors analyze the many DfS approaches based on four innovation levels: 

(1) product innovation level; 

(2) Product-Service System innovation level.

(3) Spatio-social innovation level. 

(4) Socio-Technical System innovation level.
