> Under these circumstances, it is not enough for designers to be politically and chemically correct. “Organic”, “green”, “environmental”, and “sustainable” are buzzwords that have been applied in earnest to design – including food and fashion – over the last two decades, as have “ethical” and “aware”. Yet, despite these noble intentions, we are still, as individuals and communities, tracking a course of destruction through overconsumption and disregard for countless forms of life, including our own. Much design has been violent. (Antonelli, 2019)

### 1.1 Meeting point!

_The crisis ahead of the Earth community is one of political, socioeconomic, and ecological nature_. _Not just political, or socioeconomic, or ecological, but all three, deeply connected and indissociable_. This statement (made in the introduction) is clear, but its fundamental reasons are still to be clarified. What does the socioeconomic crisis have to do with the environment? How do politics interact with all these other systems? Through the analysis of the historical and contemporary concepts of Nature and economic development, we will start exploring the underlying framework that connects these worlds.

### 1.2 Defining Politics of Nature

[Ecology]{.highlight} is defined by Oxford Dictionary as “the branch of biology that deals with the relations of organisms to one another and to their physical surroundings” and is oftentimes regarded as separate from other branches of [political]{.footnote .footnote10 .highlight}  discussions. Instead, what is called [economy]{.footnote .footnote11 .highlight} or the flow of productive activities is, today, a central concern of politics, while the environmental impact of these economic activities remain referred to as “externalities”, raising a symbolic boundary between Nature and the realm of human influence (Raworth, 2017, p. 269). However, the same economy is the predominant exercise that extracts, transforms, and exchanges [natural beings]{.footnote .footnote12 .highlight} globally, establishing a complex system that supports people’s life on Earth while Nature is, for most, a provider of human resources (food, materials or clean air) or enjoyment (through tourism or animal spectacles, for example). Therefore, the division between politics, Nature, and economy is not only reductive, but counterproductive to the efforts of comprehending how to work inside this network. [The decisions that concern if and how humans will collectively interact with Nature (phenomena that today is predominantly economic) is certainly political, and this is how this work defines Politics of Nature]{.highlight}.
